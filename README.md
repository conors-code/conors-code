### Hi all
Welcome to my profile page. 

At present, I've workied for years on Java and JavaScript. Now I'm learning Rust & Solidity and kikcing off with GitHub (my workplaces have always used version control that *isn't* GitHub, so I'm new to it).  Repos here will mostly reflect those technical interests. <br>
During work I use SQL & PL/SQL, as well as SAS.

I'm learning Rust because I'm interested in writing good, working code and Web3, Polkadot / Kusama mainly.  I'm learning Solidity because it's the smart contract standard.
